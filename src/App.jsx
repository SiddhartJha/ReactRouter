// In this project we are goig to learn react-router-dom. in this we are going to make a page where the
// header and footer will be same throughout just the middle content will be change on the basis
// of on which route we are going like Home, ContactUs, About. in all these things there is no use of
// App.jsx to import components and the rendering them but we are going to use react-router-dom functionalities
// to do these things. in this mostly things will be done in main file.
